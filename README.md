BitcoinAddressLabeler
=====================

Simple Safari extension to replace the addresses shown on mytrezor.com with custom labels. Labels are stored in the
browser's local storage and can be exported for safekeeping.

Because the labels are stored in local storage, they will not be visible when the Trezor is used in another browser
(or computer).

The current version can be downloaded from [http://public.teknonsys.com/bal.safariextz](http://public.teknonsys.com/bal.safariextz).
